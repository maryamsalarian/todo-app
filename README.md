# To-Do List App

Welcome to To-Do List!<br/><br/>
This is a simple yet powerful client-side task management application built with **React**, **Vite**, and **Typescript**. The app allows you to create, edit, mark as done (or undone), and delete tasks, all while storing your data in local storage.

## Features

**Create Tasks:** Easily add tasks in an intuitive and user-friendly interface.<br/>
**Mark Tasks as Done/Undone:** Cross off completed tasks. Changed your mind? No worries! You can reverse this action.<br/>
**Edit Tasks:** Modify tasks in place with immediate visual updates.<br/>
**Delete Tasks:** Remove tasks from your list when they're no longer needed.<br/>
**Local Storage:** All tasks are saved in the browser, with no backend required.<br/>
**Fast Runtime:** Enabled by Vite, which provides near-instant hot module reloads.<br/>

<br/>
Please note that due to time constraints, unit tests were not implemented. However, feel free to explore and play around with the app.

## Setup

1. Download or clone the repository and unzip it.
2. Ensure you have Node.js installed, then run:  **npm install**
3. Start the dev server: **npm run dev**
4. Vite will display a local URL similar to **http://localhost:5173/**. Click on it and the app will open in your browser!
5. Hope you enjoy!
